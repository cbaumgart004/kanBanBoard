# Kan Ban Board

## Description

This is a simple KanBan board format that allows users, using local storage, to add, edit, and delete tasks. Users can also organize tasks by categories "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Note that all tasks that are overdue will turn red to alert the user that this task needs to be accomplished. All tasks due today are coded yellow. All tasks that are done turn green and get a little extra smiley face. Users can update the status of a task either by adjusting the dropdown menu OR dragging the task into the corresponding swim lane.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

No additional steps are required to run this application.

## Usage

Use the Add Task button to add a new Task. By Default, your new tasks will be assigned the status of "To Do". Add as many tasks as you like. You can modify the status of each task by either selecting the dropdown menu and reassigning, or by dragging the task itself into another column. Tasks that are due today will turn yellow, overdue tasks are red. All done tasks will turn green, as seen here.
